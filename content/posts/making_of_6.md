[Part 5]({{ url_for('post', name='making_of_5') }})

One of the goals I had for this site when starting was the ability to have
interactive plots. Making a beautiful figure is nice, but it is so much more fun
when you can zoom, have floating tooltips, and take advantage of the fact that
you're on a computer, not staring at a piece of printed paper.

## Plotting library comparison - why Plotly?

## Integrating Plotly into my site's architecture

### Flatpages (markdown) + JavaScript + jQuery ðŸ˜¥

### Other required changes

## Making of the plot

<div id='chart' class='chart'></div>
<script src='https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js'></script>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js"></script>

<script type='text/javascript'>
  var graphs = $.getJSON('/covid_graph/');
  graphs.done(function(data) {
    var layout = {};
    data.config = {
      responsive: true,
      showTips: false,
    };
    Plotly.newPlot('chart', data, layout)});
</script>

no more graph
