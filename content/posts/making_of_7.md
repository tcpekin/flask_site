[Part 6.1]({{ url_for('post', name='making_of_6_quick_note') }})

Once upon a time, this site was running (just fine, I might add) using HTTP. I
don't currently do anything with user data, outside of getting crystal
orientations and ids in the URL, so I initially tried to hold off on the thought
that HTTPS was necessary to be a _real_ website.

Then I showed the site to Max, a friend of mine who somehow has already done
everything web related that I've talked about so far, years before me, and he
sends me this:

<figure>
<img async src="{{ url_for('static',filename='/assets/img/making_of_7/max1.png') }}" alt="Max's insult" class="med_2">
<figcaption class="med_2">Thanks Max.</figcaption>
</figure>

followed by his site

<figure>
<img async src="{{ url_for('static',filename='/assets/img/making_of_7/max2.png') }}" alt="Max's &quot;site&quot;" class="med_2">  
<figcaption class="med_2">Max's fully heroku based security ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</figcaption>
</figure>

and a thinly veiled threat that his site was going to beat up my site:

<figure>
<img async src="{{ url_for('static',filename='/assets/img/making_of_7/max3.png') }}" alt="Max's threat" class="med_2">  
<figcaption class="med_2">üò±</figcaption>
</figure>

That does it... now I have to add HTTPS.

## Adding HTTPS, take 1

First off, what is HTTPS and what is it good for?
[Take it from Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/why-use-https/)
as to why sites should use HTTPS. In my case, implementing it

-   <del>is to secure my users' data</del> - I am my only user
-   <del>is to make me feel like I have any idea what I'm doing on the web,
    thereby quelling my imposter syndrome</del>
-   <del>is to keep my site safe from Max's</del> - there is no competing with
    **Hero**ku
-   is for general knowledge - I can successfully Google things üéâ
-   has no purpose but seems like a cool thing - your definition of cool may
    vary

With that in mind, right after I [registered my
domain]({{ url_for('post', name='making_of_5') }}), I saw that you could
download a SSL certificate bundle and use it to secure your site. Thanks
Porkbun, that sounds like exactly what I wanted!

Turns out, that wasn't what I wanted. Certificates expire and have to be renewed
every so often, and if you forget about that, your site will look scary again,
meaning you're constantly checking Porkbun or your site for an expired
certificate. And then, when it expires, immediately you have to download the
next one and manually move it to the remote hosting server, to keep your site
"safe". It seemed like there should be a better way.

### What was done before

A long time ago, the web was a collection of text files, and certificates that
you needed for HTTPS were sold by companies... or something like that. They cost
money but people used HTTP and were happy in their ignorance. That was me. I was
happy not knowing anything about this. Anways,

## Enter Let's Encrypt and `certbot`

[Let's Encrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let's_Encrypt) brought the
internet out of its dark ages, providing free HTTPS certificates for anyone who
asked. Internet scams and spammers were forever banished from the World Wide Web
and the people rejoiced.

<figure>
<img async src="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/are-nfts-a-scam-article.png" alt="Bored ape yacht club NFTs are a scam">  
<figcaption>The internet is a serious place and definitely not full of frauds.</figcaption>
</figure>

Anyways, the major <del>browser</del> internet companies agreed with Let's
Encrypt that internet safety was a good thing, and therefore put the big locks
on the address bar (see above) if your site was HTTPS. I am 100% sure that no
non-tech user ever even looks for it, but at least it's there. Look at the üîí
people... please.

In order to make the transition to HTTPS less painful, Let's Encrypt/the
Electronic Frontier Foundation provides a very handy bot that helps with the
HTTPS set up, called [`certbot`](https://certbot.eff.org/). Certbot promises an
easy way to set up HTTPS in collaboration with Let's Encrypt, so I started to
play around with it. Ideally, you can put in the server (`nginx`) and Linux
distro (Ubuntu 20.04) that you're using into the home page and it just tells you
which commands to run, and `certbot` then modifies your `nginx` configuration
file, downloading the files you need, performing the authentication, _et voila_,
you have HTTPS.

I tried this for about a day before I realized this wouldn't work.

## Docker enters, menacingly

Why doesn't the straightforward approach work? In one word, Docker.

Before going down the route of setting up HTTPS, the structure of this site's
Docker configuration didn't really need to interact with the outside world (in
the form of the server that the code was running on). I didn't really have
logging set up, and after I had set up `nginx` and Flask, I didn't think I
needed any more containers.

That proved to be false - in order to run `certbot`, such that it can renew the
certificates itself, it needs to be in a container, and the `certbot` and
`nginx` container need to be able to talk to each other, in the form of volumes.

Volumes are just directories within containers mapped to each other, or mapped
to folders on the host system, such that an update in one container can be seen
in another.

After banging my head against the wall for another day trying to get this work
from scratch, I totally gave up on that. There seems to be a chicken and the egg
problem - to get a certificate from Let's Encrypt, since our Docker containers
are behind `nginx`, we need `nginx` to run to get our certificates, but `nginx`
won't run unless it has a certificate... so how do you get the first
certificate?

The solution is to use
[this](https://pentacent.medium.com/nginx-and-lets-encrypt-with-docker-in-less-than-5-minutes-b4b8a60d3a71)
blogpost (also repeated below), and use the script they provide in order to get
around that for you. The script can be found in the repository for
[my site](https://github.com/tcpekin/flask_site/blob/d56c400c00a815fec830ab0e11a757c3b502c546/init-letsencrypt.sh)
as well.

Note a few changes from the blog post - my `data_path` in the shell script is
instead `services/certbot`, and I've added `--no-eff-email` to the options when
getting the certificates, to minimize user interaction.

### Updating the `docker-compose` file

The
[`docker-compose` file](https://github.com/tcpekin/flask_site/blob/d56c400c00a815fec830ab0e11a757c3b502c546/docker-compose.prod.yaml)
needed some updates to make this work, partially reproduced below.

```yaml
nginx:
    build: ./services/nginx
    platform: linux/arm64/v8
    volumes:
      - ./services/certbot/conf:/etc/letsencrypt
      - ./services/certbot/www:/var/www/certbot
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 443:443
    init: true
    depends_on:
      - web
  certbot:
    image: certbot/certbot
    volumes:
      - ./services/certbot/conf:/etc/letsencrypt
      - ./services/certbot/www:/var/www/certbot
    depends_on:
      - nginx
```

This generally follows what happens in the blog post, with a few differences.
First - I have a `Dockerfile` in my `nginx` services folder, in which I copy in
the `nginx.conf` file, so I `build` my container rather than just clone the
public image like in the blog post. In doing so, I also do not mount a volume
that links the `conf` files, as my `Dockerfile` copies it into the correct
location.

Note that there is a new port mapping (443, for HTTPS), and that the volumes
that are mounted between the `host:container` are the same for both the
`certbot` container and the `nginx` container. This is how they will be able to
give each other files. Finally I added `depends_on: nginx` in the `certbot`
container, so that it wouldn't try to start until `nginx` was running, as I
thought that might cause some problems with the order of operations.

### Updating the `nginx.conf` file

The
[`nginx` file](https://github.com/tcpekin/flask_site/blob/d56c400c00a815fec830ab0e11a757c3b502c546/services/nginx/nginx.conf)
also had a lot of updates done to it, to make it compatible with HTTPS.

```nginx
upstream flask_site {
    server web:5001;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name tcpekin.com;
    server_tokens off;

    location / {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }
    location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
    root /var/www/certbot;
    default_type "text/plain";
    }
}
```

In this first part, where we handle HTTP requests on port 80, we essentially
just redirect everything internally to the HTTPS version of the site using
`nginx` variables `$host` and `$request`. However, we have to add the next
lines, where we handle the `acme-challenge` to authenticate our site. This would
be the source of all our future problems. Finally, I added based on some forum
somewhere (link below) the `default_type` as plaintext.

One interesting thing that I will have to take advantage of more in the future
when setting up better static file routing is the
[`root` variable](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/serving-static-content/)
in the `location` block. When that is part of a `location` block, URLs that
match that block will have their request prepended with `root`. That means when
the authentication procedure looks for something in the `acme-challenge` folder,
it will look for matching files in
`/var/www/certbot/.well-known/acme-challenge/filename` (which is mapped to
`./services/certbot/www` on our host filesystem) instead of
`https://$host$request_uri`. This is how `certbot` and `nginx` get the files in
the right location for each other.

```nginx
server{
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name tcpekin.com;
    server_tokens off;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/tcpekin.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/tcpekin.com/privkey.pem;
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://flask_site/;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For    $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header Host               $http_host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP          $remote_addr;
        proxy_redirect off;
    }
}
```

This next block handles the HTTPS requests - it is almost directly the same as
what was in the blog post that inspired this adventure, but the only thing that
changes is that the there is a reverse proxy, and I have previously defined an
`upstream`, so I can just use `http://flask_site/` as before. Most everything
else that looks new was added just following the guide and is just links to the
new required SSL certificates.

This is pretty much the extent of the files that needed to change

## Actually getting the certificates

Now came the fun part - how to actually get the certificates. First off, I found
this very hard to test locally. Most of the time, I like to try everything
locally (one of the advantages of Docker), and then when I have to go to the
server, it is very easy to ssh in, `git pull` the code, and just restart the
Docker containers.

This doesn't really work with `localhost`. Let's Encrypt has kind of a
[workaround](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/certificates-for-localhost/) for
testing, but that doesn't really work when the task itself is to fetch said
certificate. So I had to do everything remotely on my very poor (but trusty!)
Oracle instance.

How hard could it be though - like the blog says, once you're set up just run
`sudo ./init-letsencrypt.sh` and we're good to go!

### We are not good to go

<figure>
<img async src="https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/027/528/519.png" alt="So that was a lie Tyler the Creator meme">  
</figure>

This is a pretty common theme now. I run the `.sh` script and... I get a variety
of error messages, first of the variety that the dummy private key could not be
written (no write access), then that the certification bot could not access the
necessary files in the `acme-challenge` folder. This continued for hours. The
first thing I checked were the files that I had changed, but `nginx.conf` and
the `docker-compose.(dev/prod).yaml` both looked ok.

With regards to the first error, I thought it might be a problem with file and
directory permissions. Lo and behold, when I ran `ls -l services/certbot`, I saw
that some directories were owned by me, `tompekin` while others were owned by
`root`, a consequence of running the init script with `sudo`. So, I switched to
running it as myself, not sudo, and it worked!

However, then the second error occurred (reproduced below):

```text
Requesting a certificate for tcpekin.com and www.tcpekin.com

Certbot failed to authenticate some domains (authenticator: webroot). The Certificate Authority reported these problems:
  Domain: tcpekin.com
  Type:   unauthorized
  Detail: 130.61.99.151: Invalid response from http://tcpekin.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/some_string: 404

  Domain: www.tcpekin.com
  Type:   unauthorized
  Detail: 130.61.99.151: Invalid response from http://www.tcpekin.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/some_string: 404

Hint: The Certificate Authority failed to download the temporary challenge files created by Certbot. Ensure that the listed domains serve their content from the provided --webroot-path/-w and that files created there can be downloaded from the internet.

Some challenges have failed.
Ask for help or search for solutions at https://community.letsencrypt.org. See the logfile /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log or re-run Certbot with -v for more details.
```

So, someone is looking for a specific file, but is not able to find it! This of
course won't work when I'm working locally, so I ssh'd into the server, reran
the init script.. and it still failed ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

At this point I was afraid of rate limits, so I set `staging=1` in the init
script, which means that there is no real rate limit, but also (to my
knowledge), you can test the authentication, but you don't get delivered the
final certificates you need. Good enough for now.

If you look at the error, the certifier is looking for a file in the
`acme-challenge` folder, that should be generated by `certbot`. My first thought
was that, since that folder was empty after running the script, the file was not
being written. This took a while to figure out that no, that was not the case
and that `certbot`
[clears this directory](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38382739/certbot-not-creating-acme-challenge-folder#comment69458143_38385186)
upon completion. Just normal info you find in a StackOverflow comment üôÉ.

So, I tried to look at what the log file was saying, requiring me to mount
another drive (remember, everything is happening inside Docker), but that wasn't
so helpful. I forget what it said, but it was kind of just a bog standard error
message, but one that took 15 minutes to figure out how to even view.

Then, I just started poking around the `certbot` folder, wondering if it was a
`sudo`/`root` problem again. Sadly, very sadly after spending so much time on
this, it was. Looking at the subfolders and files inside of the
`services/certbot` directory (once again, created by the init script), they were
owned by `root:root`. To remedy this, I ran `sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu .` to
recursively change everything to the `ubuntu` (default) user on the server,
reran the init script, and everything worked! I modified the `docker-compose`
[file a little](https://github.com/tcpekin/flask_site/commit/d56c400c00a815fec830ab0e11a757c3b502c546#diff-4cce9e7eeaf3c93f53c854d694b9fe47df078a72a5a193f2b397aeca74365373)
(again, according to the
[blog post I was following](https://pentacent.medium.com/nginx-and-lets-encrypt-with-docker-in-less-than-5-minutes-b4b8a60d3a71),
see previous two links for the changes), so that certificates automatically
renew, and we're done! Almost.

### Final steps - certificates are appended with numbers ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

When I ran the init script, it downloaded certificates for `tcpekin.com-0001`
instead of `tcpekin.com`, I guess because `tcpekin.com` certs already existed
from some failed run. This might have caused a problem during certificate
renewal, so after some searching around, I followed the steps outlined
[here](https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/numbered-suffixes-in-the-live-directory/90113/4),
and all was gravy. The init script ran without a problem, followed by a
`docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml up --build`, and the site now has
HTTPS!

<figure>
<img async src="{{ url_for('static',filename='/assets/img/making_of_7/success.png') }}" alt="Screenshot of chrome lock - successs" class="med_2">
<figcaption class="med_2">This is what success looks like.</figcaption>
</figure>

### But why was this happening

The question remains - why was this happening? Why was the init script, run
without `sudo`, creating directories with `root` owners? To the best of my very
limited knowledge, this is
[expected](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39794793/docker-volume-option-create-folder-as-root-user)
[behavior](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/3206). When a folder is created
with a root user in the container, it has the same permissions _on the host
machine_. That honestly seems like a dealbreaker for any sort of shared system
(high performance computing uses [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/) instead of
Docker, and I wonder if this is different there), and a security issue. There
seem to be some workarounds, but on a machine that I fully control, I guess
`chmod` is good enough. But after shooting myself in the foot 1000 times with
permissions, hopefully I check that first next time. Or get into the habit of
using `chmod` in my Dockerfiles.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, my site is safe. Maybe. I still haven't figured out if my
forwarded header settings are correct (how to correctly set proxy headers and
tell Flask how many there are is somehow very hard for me to find online), but
now there is a lock in the URL, so bad guys beware.

In all honestly, this was much harder than expected, and took me like 2 days to
fully figure out. Maybe I'm just dumb, but in this case, Docker and `nginx` made
things much harder than a lot of the tutorials that I saw. I'm very happy that
one
[blog post](https://pentacent.medium.com/nginx-and-lets-encrypt-with-docker-in-less-than-5-minutes-b4b8a60d3a71)
exists, because it got me 98% of the way there, and I don't think I would have
made it otherwise.

I hope I don't have to deal with this again, but if I do, I hope I've given
myself enough clues with the relevant git commits and this post. ü§û

## Addenda

### Line numbers in code blocks

I wanted line numbers in my code blocks, and luckily that is a common request -
I could modify `codehilite` in the Flask-Flatpages package with the following
code that I added to `blog.py`.

```python
FLATPAGES_EXTENSION_CONFIGS = {
    'codehilite': {
        'linenums': 'True'
    }
}
```

Now I can say, in line 3 something happens, and nobody has to count üòé.

### Fixing table overflow errors

Adding line numbers broke my code blocks üò≠ - unbelievable how that happens.
Before, I was limiting the width of the `pre` elements that made up the code
block, but after adding line numbers, what actually happens is there is a two
column table, one column for the numbers and one column for the code. Each of
those were a `pre` element, and therefore the table was twice as wide. So, what
I had to do is remove the width restrictions on `pre` and instead add the
following code

```css
table {
    overflow-x: scroll;
    display: block;
}
```

`table`s already had the same `width` specification as everything else, I just
had to let them scroll. And that's the state of the project üóº.
