title: Tom Pekin, PhD

I am a a postdoc at the Humboldt Universität zu Berlin, where I am a member of
Christoph Koch’s
[Structure Research and Electron Microscopy](https://www.physics.hu-berlin.de/en/sem)
group. I currently work on developing ptychographic methods using the electron
microscope. Previously, I did my PhD under
[Andrew Minor](https://aminor.mse.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley and the National
Center for Electron Microscopy, where I focused on method development at the
intersection of electron microscopy and structural materials science.

My research has focused on combining _in situ_ electron microscopy methods with
high speed 4DSTEM techniques, with the hope of discovering new
structure-property relationships that can then be exploited to improve material
properties.

My current research interests primarily focus on developing electron
ptychography as an established and reliable method, which includes improving the
reproducibility and ease of data acquisition, preprocessing, reconstruction, and
analysis. Currently, that involves acquiring the data on a Nion UltraSTEM,
streamlining the preprocessing in Python, and then reconstructing the object
potential using [Adorym](https://github.com/mdw771/adorym). As long term goals,
I hope to increase the speed of both acquisition and reconstruction, increase the
robustness of the reconstruction of thick samples, and extend the technique to
reliably reconstruct amorphous and/or beam sensitive samples.

Outside of work I enjoy live music, various water sports, coding, and learning
German.
