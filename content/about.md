title: Tom Pekin, PhD

After 9 years in academia, I recently (Jan. 2023) switched to my current position as a Team
Product Owner at the semiconductor mask solutions (SMS) branch of Carl Zeiss
SMT, located in Jena, Germany. More info will come as I learn what I can talk
about and not ðŸ™ƒ.

Prior to the switch to industry, I was a a postdoc at the Humboldt UniversitÃ¤t
zu Berlin, where I was a member of Christoph Kochâ€™s
[Structure Research and Electron Microscopy](https://www.physics.hu-berlin.de/en/sem)
group. There I worked on developing ptychographic methods using electron
microscopy and high-end STEM/EELS on a Nion UltraSTEM. Previously, I did my PhD
under [Andrew Minor](https://aminor.mse.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley and the
National Center for Electron Microscopy, where I focused on method development
at the intersection of electron microscopy and structural materials science.

My research interests included electron ptychography and computational
microscopy, as well as combining _in situ_ electron microscopy methods with
4DSTEM techniques, with the hope of discovering new structure-property
relationships that could then be exploited to improve material properties. I
enjoyed working with diverse classes of materials, including catalytic
materials, bulk metallic glasses, structural steels, and 2D materials like MoS2
and graphene. I also enjoyed teaching and incorporating Python into physics and
materials science courses and research.

Outside of work I enjoy live music, various water sports, coding, and learning
German.
